# word-finder
Find words for word games and crossword puzzles. This single-page web app lets you specify a pool of letters to use

## Getting Started
The project is all flat HTML/JS/CSS so all you need to do is serve the main directory from a web server, for example:

```
npx serve
```

## Updating Dictionary
The dictionary is a JSON file containing a single array of words (although this might change to include definitions)

You can customize the word list in any way you want.

## Used words
